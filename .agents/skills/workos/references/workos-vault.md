## Gotchas
- BYOK requires customer-side IAM permissions granting WorkOS access to their KMS. Your app cannot do this programmatically — provide customers with IAM policy templates from the BYOK docs.
- Vault encrypts data per WorkOS organization. Every operation requires an `organization_id` — there is no global/unscoped access.
- Do NOT use internal customer IDs as `organization_id`. WorkOS organization IDs have format `org_*`. Always map through WorkOS APIs.
- Key context metadata is NOT encrypted separately. Do not store sensitive data or PII in metadata fields.
- Vault keys are case-sensitive. Mismatched casing between store and retrieve silently returns "key not found."
- BYOK KMS IAM changes can take 5-10 minutes to propagate. Customer must grant `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:Encrypt` on their key.
