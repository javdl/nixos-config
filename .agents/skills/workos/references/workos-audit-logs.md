## Gotchas
- Event type naming MUST follow `{group}.{object}.{action}` convention (e.g., `user.account.created`). Flat names like `shareCreated` are rejected.
- Metadata limits: 50 keys max per metadata object, 40 chars per key name, 500 chars per value. Exceeding silently truncates or fails.
- Log Streams to customer SIEMs via HTTP POST require IP allowlisting. WorkOS US egress IPs: `3.217.146.166`, `23.21.184.92`, `34.204.154.149`, `44.213.245.178`, `44.215.236.82`, `50.16.203.9`. EU region uses different IPs — check docs.
- If metadata schema validation is enabled in the Dashboard, events that don't match the JSON Schema are rejected. Disable temporarily if blocking deployment.
- Log Stream must show "Active" status in Dashboard to deliver events. Credential or network issues silently stop delivery without failing the event creation call.
