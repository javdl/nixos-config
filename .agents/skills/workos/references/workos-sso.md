## Gotchas
- Use exactly ONE connection selector (connection, organization, or provider) in getAuthorizationUrl — never combine them, causes error
- domain_hint and login_hint are UX params, NOT connection selectors — they pre-fill fields but don't route the request
- IdP-initiated flow sends state="" (empty string, not missing) — skip CSRF verification for empty string, reject for null/missing
- Auth codes expire in 10 min and are single-use — exchange immediately in callback, never store or retry
- signin_consent_denied means user clicked Cancel at IdP — check req.query.error BEFORE attempting code exchange
- Email domain does NOT auto-resolve to organization — YOUR app must map email domain → org_id via your DB or the Organizations API
- Redirect URI must match EXACTLY including trailing slash — mismatch causes invalid_grant
- Use getProfileAndToken (not getProfile) to exchange code — returns both profile and access token
