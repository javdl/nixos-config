## Gotchas
- Always check permissions (role.permissions.includes('action')), NOT role slugs (role.slug === 'admin') — slug checks break in multi-org with custom roles. Claude defaults to slug checks.
- Role assignment requires the MEMBERSHIP ID, not the user ID — fetch via listOrganizationMemberships() first, then call updateOrganizationMembership(membershipId, { roleSlug })
- IdP group mapping OVERRIDES API/Dashboard role assignments on every auth — updateOrganizationMembership() changes silently revert on next login if IdP mapping exists
- IdP role mapping only works with environment-level roles, NOT org-level roles
- First org-level role creation isolates that org permanently — it stops inheriting environment-level role changes. This is irreversible.
- Org-level role slugs are auto-prefixed with "org:" — use the full slug "org:custom_admin", not just "custom_admin"
- Stale session after role change — role assigned after login won't take effect until user re-authenticates. Force re-auth or refresh the session.
- Permission slug typos fail silently — "video.create" vs "videos.create" won't error, just denies access
