## Gotchas
- Do not implement both webhooks and Events API polling simultaneously — this causes duplicate event processing.
- Webhook endpoints must return 200 OK within 5 seconds. Acknowledge immediately, process asynchronously.
- Verify webhook signature before processing using the raw request body. JSON-parsing the body before verification breaks the signature check.
- `WORKOS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is shown only once when registering the endpoint. Save it immediately.
- WorkOS may retry webhook deliveries. All event processing must be idempotent — deduplicate using `event.id`, not webhook delivery ID.
- For Events API polling, `last_event_id` must be stored persistently. If lost, you must backfill via date-range queries.
- Do NOT backfill by replaying webhooks. Webhook signatures expire. Always use the Events API for historical data.

## Endpoints
| Endpoint  | Description   |
