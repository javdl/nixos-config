## Gotchas
- Portal links are single-use and time-limited. Visiting an expired or already-used link returns 404. Must generate a new link each time.
- Do NOT email portal links directly from your backend. Links are exposed in email logs. Instead, store the link and have your app's settings page redirect to it.
- The `intent` parameter determines which configuration screens appear. It cannot be changed after link generation — must generate a new link for a different intent.
- Only one active portal link exists per organization at a time. Revoke the old one before generating a new one.
- Domain verification may be required before SSO activation. Some configurations need DNS TXT records or email verification first.
- API key must start with `sk_` (secret key). Using `pk_` (publishable key) returns "Unauthorized."
