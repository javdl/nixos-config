"""Filesystem and Git archive helpers for MCP Agent Mail.

Concurrency Architecture:
- Per-project archive locks (.archive.lock) serialize archive mutations
- Per-project commit locks (.commit.lock) serialize git commit operations
- Commit queue with batching reduces lock contention under high load
- Adaptive retry with exponential backoff + jitter for transient failures

Key Design Decisions:
1. File locks use SoftFileLock (cross-platform, doesn't require OS support)
2. Lock metadata (.owner.json) enables stale lock detection and cleanup
3. Process-level asyncio.Lock prevents re-entrant acquisition within same process
4. Git index.lock errors are retried with exponential backoff + stale cleanup

    Instead of each operation acquiring a lock, performing a commit, and releasing,

    high concurrency.

    Design:
    - Commits are queued with asyncio.Future for result notification
    - A background task processes the queue periodically or when full
    - Non-conflicting commits (different file paths) are batched together
    - Conflicting commits are processed sequentially
