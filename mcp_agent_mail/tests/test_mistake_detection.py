"""Tests for common mistake detection helpers and UX improvements.

These tests verify that the mistake detection helpers correctly identify:
1. Program names mistakenly used as agent names
2. Model names mistakenly used as agent names
3. Email addresses mistakenly used as agent names
4. Broadcast attempts
5. Descriptive role names
6. Suspicious file reservation patterns
